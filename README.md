To set up the environment, run:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

This will create a python environment called `.venv` with all the required dependencies and install the dune_plot_style module to be used in the scripts (checkout [dune_plot_style](https://github.com/DUNE/dune_plot_style) for more details).
To run the scripts, you can use:

```bash
python3 run_all.py
```
